# Garment-Workers-and-Productivity
Statistical Learning team project. Predicting the actual productivity of garment workers. 

The dataset includes important attributes of the garment manufacturing process and the productivity of the employees which had been collected manually and also been validated by the industry experts. Data have been collected across different days along the year, and each row (instance) contains different characteristics of a specific worker team devoted at performing a specific task.

The Garment Industry is one of the key examples of the industrial globalization of this modern era. It is a highly labour-intensive industry with lots of manual processes. Satisfying the huge global demand for garment products is mostly dependent on the production and delivery performance of the employees in the garment manufacturing companies. So, it is highly desirable among the decision makers in the garments industry to track, analyse and predict the productivity performance of the working teams in their factories.
